## Web journal PWA

This app will be a simple UI that allows me (or maybe other eventual users) to fill a form each day with info in how I'm progressing on some web dev goals I fixed myself.

It will be kind of like a journal, but with some specific fields as well. Example, one for the book I'm currently reading and another field for the number of pages I read each day. This will allow me to see some statistics I can leverage.

I will probably hook this up with a Postgres DB, or Mongo DB, not sure yet...

This is also to experiment with TailwindCSS and service workers / progressive web apps.
